# About This Project
Klimt is an offensive security tool designed for credential stealing, system information analysis and security assessments. It features a range of options for compromising different types of systems and applications, including Discord, Various CryptoCurrency Wallets, Web Browsers, Roblox, and [many more](https://github.com/codeuk/klimt#features). Klimt also includes a persistent reverse shell option that allows users to execute commands from a remote server, along with an interactive GUI builder.

-- 2nd Note: **When using this program, do not upload the stub (build/agent.exe) to any virus scanning platforms (ex. VirusTotal) as this will only increase detections in the future.**

## Installation

To install Klimt, make sure you have [GoLang](https://go.dev) installed and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/codeuk/klimt.git`
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you installed Klimt in.
3. Install the required dependencies using `go get ./...`
4. Build the builder using `go build builder.go` or by opening the `build.bat` file if you're on Windows.

## Usage

To use the Klimt Builder, follow these steps:

1. In the Klimt directory, run `builder` or open the new `builder.exe` file to open the Klimt Stealer Builder.
2. Wait a few seconds, and when the builder GUI opens, configure it how you wish and press `Compile Stealer`.
3. If the build is successful, the executable should be in `build/agent.exe`, and can now use this stub as you wish.

The stealer build is approx. 4MB (UPX'd) and so far FUD (0 detections with the Pro Version, at least.), though I'd still recommend using a dropper when putting it to operational use.

Users of Klimt are solely responsible for their actions and are advised to use the tool for legitimate security testing purposes only.
